Build websites like it's 2004. Create super simple web pages using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and/or HTML. Comes with templating via `ejs`. Built with node and typescript, it's perfect for github pages or simple resume sites!

Keep it simple! Or expand this! You can use Javascript directly in `.ejs` files. You can also dig into the `build.ts` and hijack the `copyDir` to add any preprocess stuff. Hack away 🤓!!

## Demo

Check out [the demo](https://petergrillot.github.io/webgen) as well as my [portfolio](https://petergrillot.github.io/) built with `Markdown`.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webgen.git my-cool-site
cd my-cool-site
node setup.js
```

### Clean Setup

You will be prompted to clean out the example folder. If (y)es, the `pages` directory will be clean for you to add you first markdown page.

> This readme will be deleted an replace with further instructions.
